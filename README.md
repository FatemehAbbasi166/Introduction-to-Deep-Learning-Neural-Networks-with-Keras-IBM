# Introduction-to-Deep-Learning-Neural-Networks-with-Keras-IBM
In this module, you will learn about exciting applications of deep learning and why now is the perfect time to learn deep learning. You will also learn about neural networks and how most of the deep learning algorithms are inspired by the way our brain functions and the neurons process data. Finally, you will learn about how neural networks feed data forward through the network.
